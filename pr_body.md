This branch and all its commits are focussed on creating tests for an existing code base. Before this branch no tests were created. All tests are generated by AI. Can you run through these tests and remove any tests of things that are not written by me. So no tests for plugins or components that I'm using.

Than, when you have cleaned it. Run type checks and eslints, and of course tests. And fix any errors that you find.
