Can you run all the tests and fix them? I'm currently at the place where (in this commit) tests have been added to the current project. So it feels weird to have failing tests.

Keep in mind. All the commits you find here in this branch are created by AI. So keep an eye out on over engineered tests. These should be removed. It should be clean & simple.
