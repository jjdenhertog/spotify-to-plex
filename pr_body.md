Title: Test suite 

Description:Analyse the entire code base to understand how everything is built. Than do a more thorough analysis and go by it file for file.

When you have a full and complete understanding of the entire code base do your research to find out how to best write unit tests for this code base. We have eslint and typescript to test for styles and errors and whatnots. So make sure to do research on how to create meaningful tests for these type of projects.

Ideally I would the test to also contain UI tests. But it is up to you to decide if that is useful.

Your goals is to create an instruction document that explains how and what tests should be build. This should be a very extensive document and contain a checklist that should be fully checked in order to complete the instruction. This instruction document should be called task_create_tests.md

Important. Refer to or integrate any CODING_GUIDELINES.md. 
Important. Do not write any code or built any test yourself. The goal is only to write the extensive md file.
