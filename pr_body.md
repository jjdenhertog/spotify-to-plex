Can you modify the task-creatr-tests.md. there are a few things:
- mqtt don't need tests. This part is likely to be removed 
- flasks/Spotify scraper tests can be removed 
- don't add performance testing. This is an app that runs locally so the performance is dependent if the users setup
- don't imagine things or add confusion by adding stuff that this app doesn't even have. Like OAuth or Payments and such.
