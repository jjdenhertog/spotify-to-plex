Can you analyse the current code base file for file. Look at it through the eye of a senior test designer. Focus on the functionalities that are worth testing. 

Than once you know the entire code base, assess the tests. Remove the tests that you find unnecessary. And add the tests that you find usefull. 

Make sure run pnpm -r run type-check. And run pnpm -r run lint. All errors should be fixed. Warnings are allrit.
