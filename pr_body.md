This branch and all its commits are the first test setup for this project. I am also nog very familiar with testing. So can you help explain it to me.

- remove any unnecessary MD files
- write one new MD files to explain the testing setup that has been created. Including each and every test created. Explaining what the test does and why it was Create. And when it will fail. 

I am a senior developer. So don't write it as if it's for a junior developer.
